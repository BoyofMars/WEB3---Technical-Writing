## 1. Introduction
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are one of the most powerful innovations in Web3. They enable online communities and protocols to make decisions without centralized leadership.

## 2. What Is a DAO?
A DAO is a community-driven organization governed by smart contracts and token voting instead of traditional management.

It uses tools like:

## 3. How DAO Governance Works
DAOs operate on proposals such as:
- Funding requests  
- Product upgrades  
- Treasury allocations  
- Rule changes  
- Strategic partnerships  

Members vote using governance tokens.
